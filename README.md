Jacob's Clone Tool (jclone)
===========================

https://naff.software

A command line tool for cloning and organising git repositories, written in Rust.

What can I say? I like to keep my repos organised.

# Usage

Use `jclone` in place of `git clone`:

```
$ jclone --depth=1 git@github.com:rust-lang/rustlings.git ~/src/rust-lang/rustlings
```

Gives you:

```
Cloning into 'rustlings'...

```
