Jacob's Clone Tool (jclone)
===========================

https://naff.software

A command line tool for cloning and organising git repositories, written in Rust.

What can I say? I like to keep my repos organised.

# Usage

Clones the given repository into `~/src/<path/to/repo>`. For example:

```
$ jclone git@github.com:rust-lang/rustlings.git
```

Gives you:

```
Cloning repository to "/home/jacob/src/github.com/rust-lang/rustlings"...
ðŸŽ‰ Done!

```
